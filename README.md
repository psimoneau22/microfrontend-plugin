dynamically load react components for a plugin or microfront-end architechture

This repo was created in 2019 and just used as a POC to show the possibility of dynamically loading react components from separate webpack builds.
Since this was created webpack has come out with federated modules which essentially solves the problem this repo was trying to show.
